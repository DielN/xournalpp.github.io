# MacOS installation

## General information

Xournal++ is a free and open source program and can be easily compiled from source, although for user convenience it is also distributed via precompiled binary. In case you want to compile xournalpp on your own you should follow the guide on the [github page](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/blob/master/readme/MacBuild.md). If you decide to do otherwise, then this guide is dedicated to that process.

## Downloading the program

<ul id="macosDownloadsContainer" class="downloadsContainer">
<li><a class="xournalppButton downloadButton" href="{{downloads.macos.stable}}">Stable (Recommended)</a></li>
<li><a class="xournalppButton linkButton" href="{{downloads.nightly}}">Nightly (latest unstable)</a></li>
<li><a class="xournalppButton linkButton" href="{{downloads.allVersions}}">Other versions</a></li>
</ul>

In case of downloading a different version than the stable one, remember to download the `macos` version.
